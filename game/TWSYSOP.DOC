Welcome!  Right now you're probably dying to configure this program
and get it running.  Before I tell about that, I just want to put a plug in
here.

Trade Wars 2002 is the result of over 11 years of game testing and
development.  The version you have in your hands is v3, our NEW version,
offerings tons of new features the players requested and some new twists that
we threw in ourselves!  It is one of the most complex games in the BBS world
at this time.  You probably can guess about the amount of development time that
went into this game.  Install and run this game for a few weeks and if you
agree that it is decent and want to keep it, you will need to register with us.
The registration fee is very small, just $25.  Being registered will keep you
in touch with further development of the game and all subsequent releases of
Trade Wars 2002 will be free of charge to you.  This un-registered version is
almost fully functional.  There are four options that do not work:

         You cannot edit any values in the Trade Wars Sysop's editor,
         Players cannot buy any of the other shiptypes in the game, and
         Players cannot build or enter Citadels on planets.
         Photon Missiles cannot be purchased.

The rest of the game works 100%  Try it, I think you'll agree that our
registration fee is cheap for what you get!

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express and US funds drawn on a US bank
ONLY!  Foreign funds will be returned as the cost of processing them is most
often more than the registration fee itself!

-------------------------- Ordering Info -----------------------------

 To register online, see "Online Ordering Info" below.

 To register via mail, send $25 (US) in check or money order to:

              Martech Software, Inc.
              P.O. Box 1358
              Lawrence, Kansas  66044

You will find an accompanying file on your harddisk called TWORDER.FRM,
please use this to send in your order as it will speed things up.

Please allow 3-4 weeks for your registration code to reach you by return mail.
We will not transmit registration codes through the net.  And we will not
call with your codes.  We have very little time to work on the game as it is.
Also, US Postal Priority Mail doesn't seem to be any faster than regular mail!
We get registrations from either coast in 3-4 days.  Please include your BBS
name, type and number as well as your address on the included form TWORDER.FRM.


----------------------- ONLINE ORDERING INFO ----------------------------


We will have online ordering available on Castle RavenLoft after Sept 1st
1996.  We're sorry it took so long to make this available, but we will have
it there for you now.  Call Castle RavenLoft at (785) 842-0300 or Telnet to
loft.martech.net and you will be able to use Visa, Mastercard or American
Express to place a credit card order.  Reg Codes will not be available
immediately, but within 2-3 days of the time you place your order.  We plan
to have this fully automated as soon as we can finish that application.


--------------------------- Update Info ---------------------------------


If you registered Trade Wars 1.xx or 0.9x before January 1st, 1994, then
you are eligible for a free upgrade to the new version 2.xx codes.  You
will find an update form included with this archive.  Get it to us and
we'll get you your new codes for 3.xx




       ---------------- Now on to the installation! ----------------




  B E F O R E you do anything else!  Copy the distribution archive 2002V302.ZIP
  to a nice safe place.  The installation process will delete the one
  from out of the BBS dir to save system space.  If you intend to
  continue a v2.xx+ game, backup your data files as well.

  YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE DATA CONVERSION, so back up those files!



  Step 1: If you are currently running Version 0.90 through 1.03d:

          ERASE ALL FILES IN THE TRADEWAR SUBDIR!  (Optionally install
          version 3 in a different subdirectory.  You can put it anywhere
          on your computer as you can fully control where the program
          looks for its data)  Version 3 is NOT compatible in
          any way with the files from Version 0.90 through 1.03d  Make
          sure and erase every file in the TRADEWAR subdirectory!

          if you are currently running Version 2+:

          If you would like to convert your data files to v3, DO NOT
          ERASE THEM FROM THE TRADEWAR SUBDIR!  If you intend to start
          a fresh game, then you may delete all files before beginning
          the installation.  It is not necessary as BIGBANG will clean up
          all data files.

  Step 2: Unzip 2002V3??.ZIP into your Tradewars game directory and it will
          create the installation package for you.  You will have to set the
          Dos Environment variable (more info later) to indicate which node
          is what.

  Step 3: Run the batch file. (INSTALL.BAT)  It will unzip everything into
          the current directory, create a directory called ANSI and put
          *.ANS into that ANSI directory.  If you want to run two versions
          of the game, make another subdirectory under your main BBS
          directory and copy EVERYTHING thats in your Tradewars subdirectory.
          You will then need to make appropriate changes to the BBS setup
          or to the batch files that you use to call Trade Wars 2002.

   Installation Notes:

   Upgrading from v2+ to v3 - Backup data files, but leave them in
     your current game directory.  After installing all new files, run
     TW2002.EXE to trigger the data conversion process.  The game will detect
     the version of the data (assumes all pre 3.00 data is 2.xx) and prompt you
     for conversion to the most current data format.  The data files will
     be backed up in the same directory.  If a file conflicts with the backup
     name, you will be prompted to overwrite the file, overwrite all files,
     or abort.  Once conversion is completed, the game will begin as usual.

     Note:  This conversion process is not two-way, so back up your original
     data files in a safe place.  Also, the data files and indexes created
     cannot be rebuilt in case of corruption, so you might consider backing
     them up with nightly processing.

   Upgrades from versions of Trade Wars prior to 2.00 are not supported.
   You must run BIGBANG.EXE to begin a new v3 game and will lose your
   current game state.

Share issues:

   SHARE.EXE must be loaded to play Trade Wars.  If TW detects a problem
   with Share, it reports an error and will not load.  This error is "Share
   not loaded or unresponsive".


   Please NOTE!!!  During a first time initialization, the BigBang Universe
   Creator must be run.  This process can take a while on slower machines.


   A LARGE portion of the Trade Wars 2002 Universe is contained in the
   External maintenance program called EXTERN.EXE   This program must be
   run once a day.  It does NOT support the modem so it should not be run
   as a logon event for users.  (it also gives out info that users shouldn't
   see).  Run it in your nightly maintenance batch file.  We have noticed that
   some other door's external maintenance files screw up the environment so
   that EXTERN will not function correctly. We recommend that you put
   EXTERN.EXE *FIRST* in your nightly batch file.



              ------  Running TW2002 on Your BBS  ------

The new version of TW2002 runs quite a bit differently than the
previous versions.  The Node configuration file determines how the system
runs, what type of door drop file should be read (and where it is) and
how communications should be handled.  There are only two command line
options that are used regularly. (there are some optional override command
line options available).

NOXMS   The NoXms switch tells TW2002 to NOT use Extended memory to load
        its overlay files.

NOEMS   The NoEms switch does the same for Expanded memory.

By default TW2002 will try to use Xms memory first, then Ems memory.  If
neither are available (in sufficient quantity) then the game will not load
its overlays into memory and your disk usage will rise considerably as the
program loads and unloads modules from the overlay file.

EXAMPLE:

  TW2002 NOXMS NOEMS

Calling Trade Wars 2002 this way would insure that no high memory was used
at all.  (Sometimes useful for systems such as Desqview)



a third, optional command line item, is an overlay buffer size.

BUFFER=x   Where x is the number of bytes to set aside for the overlay buffer.

By default, the game tries to keep 165,000 bytes for dynamic allocations
during the game, and devotes the rest to the overlay buffer.  The buffer
must be a minimum size (80,000 bytes currently), so there may be less than
165,000 bytes left over after the buffer is set.  You may override the default
if you would like to squeeze a little extra performance out of the game.
The 165,000 bytes is intended to handle a 5000 sector game, so smaller games
will require less for data allocation.  In that case, you could force the
overlay to a value that leaves about 32k-64k free while the game is running.
Check the @ command in the game for an indication of the number of overlay
reloads occuring as you play.  Each reload indicates that a block of the
overlay was moved from either disk (if no EMS or XMS is used), or memory.
Obviously the fewer, the better, though this will have a greater effect if
loading the overlay from disk without caching.

When adjusting the overlay buffer, it is important that the memory available
from the main command prompt be about 30K (see @ command).  By default, For
a 5000 sector game the overlay setting should leave 32k free just after a
player enters.  If there wasn't enough memory to meet this request, the
amount could be lower.



The fourth, optional command line item, is a node specifier.

TWNODE=x   Where x is a number from 0 to 32000

The fifth, optional command line item is useful if you want to run TW2002
on a Local area network.  Setup the nodefile for Local use, and call the
game with the TWUSER=<username> command line option.

TWUSER=name  Where name is from 1 to 40 characters long.

The sixth, optional command line is a default data directory specifier.

DATA=path  Where path is the location of the Trade Wars data files.

This path is overridden by the node-specific data directory if that path
is not default.  See RUNNING MULTIPLE TW GAMES later in this document.

The seventh, optional command line is the video write mode for local
game output.

VIDEO=mode  Where mode is FAST or SLOW.

This defaults to VIDEO=FAST, and should work with most environments.

Fast mode writes directly to video memory.  This doesn't work in all
environments, for example virtual machines where physical video memory
doesn't exist where it would on a physical machine.  In this case, you
can either configure your environment for video memory redirection,
which is automatic for most modern virtual machines, or turn direct
video writes off using VIDEO=SLOW.

The 8th, optional command line is the timeslicing mode.

MULTITASK=YES,NO

With MULTITASK=YES, the game will relinquish the timeslice not only
when it's idle, but frequently during long processing.  If you find that
the displays and input are responding too slowly, you might try turning
the MULTITASK option to NO.

With MULTITASK=NO, the game will still relinquish the timeslice when
idle, but will not during long processing.  Under operating systems
with preemptive multitasking (Win95/98/NT), there is no real need to
timeslice during processing.  Timeslicing during idle is still done
because the game would otherwise waste valuable CPU doing nothing.

The default setting is MULTITASK=NO for Win95/98/NT and MULTITASK=YES
for DOS and OS/2.

EXTERN also allows this command, but it attempts to detect if there are
any active game sessions and will run in multitasking or non-multitasking
mode depending.  You can override the auto-detect by supplying the command
line MULTITASK=YES or MULTITASK=NO.

The 9th, optional option is SHARE.

Using the command line option SHARE tells TW2002 not to bother detecting
SHARE.EXE.  Some environments supply SHARE functionality without complying
with the full SHARE specification.  In this case, it may not be detected
but still may run.  Skipping the detection step will solve this problem.


The standard method to setup TW2002 is to use a Dos Environment variable in
the autoexec batch file to indicate which node a given machine is running.

Please note!!!  This game uses much of available DOS memory.  We
recommend you shrink out most of your BBS before running TW2002.

This system is delivered in an "as-is" basis.  We do not guarantee that this
system will work on your BBS.  Any problems with your system, lost data or
corrupted files are your problems to solve.  As distributed this package will
work fine on a PC-compatible running WWIV or QBBS.  If your dog gets sick, you
lose your job or one of your users gets into a gunfight over this game with
you, it is still your responsibility.

We *ARE* glad to try and help if you are having problems getting this system
installed on your board.



Good luck trading and watch out for the Ferrengi!

Common Technical Problems and answers:


To help troubleshoot the game, Trade Wars sends error messages to standard
output.  You can capture output to a file and see what messages were sent
even if they weren't visible on the screen.  Just run the game like this:

At the command line:

  TW2002 > ERR.LOG

From a batch file:

  TW2002 TWNODE=%1 > ERR%1.LOG

Then view ERR.LOG or ERR?.LOG after the game ends to see what it reported.
It is important to include the node number in the log file when calling the
game from a batch file because if two sessions attempt to open the same log
file there will be a share violation.  This is a confusing situation as no
error will can be generated.

Q: I'm using the DPMI version.  Each game allocates ALL of my extended memory
   even though only a small amount is actually used.

A: The runtime memory manager used by Trade Wars allocates all of the available
   extended memory by default.  To override this setting, you must specify
   an environment variable with the maximum extended memory.  Add this line
   either to your main AUTOEXEC.BAT or the batch file running the game:

   SET RTM=EXTMAX 1024

   This example specifies 1024K for each session.  This can be decreased
   depending on the memory use of your particular game.  20K sector games
   will use much of this amount, but a 1000 sector game will use much less.

   NOTE:  We recommend using this environment variable for not only TW2002.EXE,
   but TEDIT.EXE, EXTERN.EXE and NONPSERV.EXE.

Q: When I get a couple of games running simultaneously, the input and display
   seems to really bog down.

A: Trade Wars releases the timeslice multiple times during long processes
   like displaying ANSIs.  Depending on the timeslicing settings, the OS may
   be slow in returning the focus to a game after it has been released.  The
   result will be a significant slow-down in the game.  This problem seems
   to be worse for Win95 than WinNT.

   A new command line switch has been added (v3.09) to address this problem.
   You can set the switch to MULTITASK=NO to avoid relinquishing the timeslice
   during processing.  Setting to MULTITASK=YES will force the game to release
   the timeslice more frequently.  Win95/98/NT games will default to
   MULTITASK=NO and DOS and OS/2 games will default to MULTITASK=YES.

Q: Whenever EXTERN is running, active games slow to a crawl.

A: Starting with v3.09, EXTERN will frequently release its CPU time so that
   other active programs will be more responsive.

   This behavior can be controlled with the MULTITASK= switch.  The default
   value for the switch for all operating systems is YES.  If you are certain
   that no other programs will be running when EXTERN is active, or you
   find that other applications respond just fine while EXTERN is running, you
   can set MULTITASK=NO to significantly increase the speed of EXTERN processing.

Q: I can run the first game session fine but I can't start a second game.  It
   starts to run but then kicks me back out immediately.  It doesn't report
   any errors.

A: If you're capturing error output to a log file, be sure you're not trying
   to send the output to the same error log.  See "Common Technical Problems"
   above for a description of capturing error reports.



Q: I can run one or more game fine, but after a certain number of games are
   running I get an error trying to run an additional game.

A: This error could be "file not found" or something else.  The cause of this
   problem is usually that there aren't enough files allocated for DOS in the
   FILES= line of CONFIG.SYS.  Even though Windows allows many files to be
   open simultaneously, Trade Wars is a DOS program and is still restricted
   by the number of files specified in CONFIG.SYS.  Each game session currently
   requires about 15 file handles.

   We recommend you set at least FILES=120 in CONFIG.SYS.



Q: When running games on multiple machines that point to a shared data
   directory, one or more of the sessions can't receive messages.

A: Clock synchronization is crucial when running on more than one machine.
   Beginning with v3.05, a new global command has been added to synchronize
   the machines.  Here's what you should do.

     1:  Run a local session on each machine
     2:  From the main machine, press &.  This will synchronize all other
         machines running local sessions to the time of this machine.

   You can certainly do this manually, if you'd prefer.  The clocks need to
   be synchronized to within a second or two.



Q: Trade Wars seems to run fine in Local mode, but goes crazy for the remote
   callers?

A: TW2002 handles its own I/O.  Make sure that you are NOT using some other
   utility program or the BBS itself to handle the Modem I/O.  A program
   such as Gateway is not needed with TW2002.  Also, make sure you are using
   the door mode on your BBS that removes the BBS from memory.  This is the
   safest setting.



Q: No matter who runs the game, it always comes up as the same player or
   as me! (the sysop) what is happening?

A: TW2002 looks for your Door Interface file wherever you told it to.  If
   you have it pointing to the wrong one (not one the BBS makes whenever
   a user tries to run the door) then it will always try to run that
   configuration.  Also, if your Dos Environment variable TWNODE isn't
   set, it will default to Node 0 (local mode)



Q: Running TW2002 on WWIV, remote callers get double characters?

A: Under WWIV's Chainedit, you have Use Dos Interrupts set to "Yes".  Turn
   that setting off as you are asking both the BBS and Trade Wars to transmit
   characters to the remote user.



Q: When I run TW2002 I keep getting error codes 002 or 103.? Its never
   worked since I got it.

A: You never ran the INSTALL.BAT file when you first got the archive.  If you
   do not run this, then the appropriate data files were not created.

                               there isn't a valid number in the file.

  Errors 150 through 162 indicate various HARDWARE failures.  If you're getting
  these, then something is wrong with your PC and I can't be of much help
  there.

	Some commone ones are:
  152  Drive not ready         Controller problem or drive not spinning
  154  CRC error in data       Scrogged disk (real technical eh? (grin))

                               error, then you have a configuration
                               problem with your multinode BBS setup.
                               Make sure Share is being run.  Also make
                               sure that the Trade Wars files are setup
                               for a Shared access mode.  You can set the
                               executables and the .ANS files to Read only
                               to facilitate this.

  Fatal errors generally indicate a problem that must be fixed before you
  can continue to run the game.

                               TW2002.OVR file.  If you're not using EMS, then
                               the .OVR file is missing or is setting on a bad
                               sector on your harddisk.  If you are running EMS
                               then you have a bad memory chip! (yak)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is a new, hidden function inside the game, accessible as a global
  command.  The @ key will display info about your system's memory:

  <@>  Game Details.  This function (a global key) displays important
       info concerning the active game session.


       The title area displays the Trade Wars version, and the environment
       that the game thinks it is running under.  If this is incorrect,
       the game may not function properly.  Supported environments are
       WinNT/95, Win3, DOS, OS2, and DESQview.

       Example:

       Trade Wars 2002 Version 3.x
       WinNT Detected.


       Memory Status:  Displays the current memory available to this
         session, as well as the largest free block and minimum bytes
         available so far.  If, while at the main command prompt, the
         current memory is much greater than 30K, you might consider
         overriding the BUFFER size to make more memory available for
         the overlay buffer.  This will increase the game's efficiency.
         See the BUFFER parameter in this document.

         The minimum bytes available value is a danger flag.  If this
         value becomes low in relation to the Object Memory, you may need
         to attempt to gain more memory for your sessions, or BIGBANG a
         smaller universe.

       Example:

       32,392 bytes available.
       32,392 largest free block available.
       29,792 minimum bytes available this session.


       Stack Status:  Displays the current and minimum stack available
         to the game.  The minimum value is an estimate, and the actual
         value is always less than or equal to this amount.  The stack
         allocation is static and defined when the game is compiled.  If
         you find the stack running dangerously low, report it to Martech,
         and we'll increase the stack size with the next release.

       Example:

       32,920 stack bytes available.
       30,154 minimum stack bytes available this session.


       Object Allocation Status:  Indicates the current and maximum pool of
       memory allocated for dynamic structures within the game.  This pool
       grows and shrinks as you access different features of the game.

       Example:

       132,856 bytes allocated.
       135,456 maximum bytes allocated.


       Overlay Buffer Statistics:  These stats help you determine the optimum
         overlay configuration for your system.  By default, the program
         attempts to allow about 135,000 bytes for dynamic allocation, and
         30,000 bytes available for future allocation when at the main
         command prompt.  The rest of memory available is given to the
         overlay buffer.  A minimum buffer size currently is 80,000 bytes.
         In order to meet this requirement, your game may show less than
         30,000 bytes free at the main command prompt.

         You can set this value yourself with the BUFFER= command line
         parameter (see RUNNING TW2002 ON YOUR BBS) to free up some more
         memory, or increase the buffer size to improve game performance.
         The Reload Count gives an indication of the number of times an
         overlay has been reloaded.  A smaller buffer will result in a
         higher reload count, and a larger buffer a smaller count.

         If this line reports "Loading from disk", then you have either
         disabled EMS, or there wasn't enough EMS memory available to load
         the overlay file.  We strongly recommend loading the overlay from
         EMS.  This requires enough memory to hold the entire TW2002.OVR
         file.  At this release, 460K will suffice.

       Example:

       Size 80,000 Bytes, Reload Count 99, Loading from EMS.


       Average Interval Lag:  Another warning sign, this value should
         ideally be small.  This is a measurement of the average amount
         of time spent in interval processing.  If it approaches or
         exceeds the interval period (the delay between background processes,
         typically one second), there is too much load on the game.  Move
         odds for Aliens and Ferrengi will effect this load, particularly
         in older games.

       Example:

       0 hundredths


Recommended Environment:

  Trade Wars 3 relies heavily on disk access to achieve the interactive
  feel of the game.  Disk caching is highly recommended to limit the
  frequency of actual hard-disk hits.  There is a noticable difference
  between a game running with and without disk caching.  Win95 and WinNT
  handle this quite nicely.  For a true DOS mode, try SmartDrive.

  This version of the game has been optimized for Windows NT server running
  Wildcat 5.  It has shown good performance under Windows 95 and DOS.  No
  testing has been done under OS/2, although the operating system is
  detected.  NOTE:  I have had reports that the DPMI version works better
  than the standard under OS/2.

Notes for DESQview users:

  Since DESQview uses a substantial amount of DOS memory, you may not be able
  to run a full-scale Trade Wars game.  Try creating a game with various
  settings for sectors, maximum users, ships, planets, etc.  These will all
  effect the amount of dynamic memory required to run the game.

  Share must be loaded prior to starting DESQview, and I recommend running
  SmartDrive or another disk caching program as well.

  If you won't be running a disk cache, you need to specify enough expanded
  memory available to load TW2002.OVR.  Otherwise, overlay access will come
  from the hard drive, which may will slow the game down on older machines.
  Currently, about 460K will suffice.

  I have run a maximum universe game under the DESQview Big DOS window,
  having set the Maximum Expanded Memory to 460K to hold the overlay file.
  With about 530K conventional memory for the window, this game runs well.
  As the game's main executable increases in size, these amounts may increase.

  Once the game has started, check the @ function to view the characteristics
  of your session.  You would like the Current Bytes Available to stay at about
  30K when at the main prompt.  Check that the Lowest Bytes Available doesn't
  get too low.  You would also like the Overlay Buffer Statistics to report a
  low Reload Count, and Loading from EMS.

  Keep the BUFFERS= setting in CONFIG.SYS reasonable.  These buffers reside
  in DOS memory, and can limit the amount of memory available to TW.

Trade Wars DPMI Version:

  What is DPMI?

  DPMI is a specification that allows DOS programs to run in protected mode
  instead of real mode.

  What are the benefits of the DPMI version?

  If you're having trouble running large games because you run out of DOS
  memory, you could benefit from the DPMI version.  Protected mode programs
  aren't limited by the 640K memory barrier.  You will have access to all
  extended memory available on your system.

  If you don't have a math-coprocessor, you should run the DPMI version.  The
  math-coprocessor emulation library is large enough that we felt it should
  not be included in the standard version to keep the size of the main
  executable as small as possible.  The library is included with the DPMI
  version because memory is not as much of a concern.

  If you own the Gold Edition, you will be able to run universes with greater
  than 5000 sectors.  These universes take so much memory that the real-mode
  version is not capable of running them.  A maximum 20,000 sector universe
  could take as much as 500K memory per game session.

  IMPORTANT:  If you run the DPMI version, we highly recommend that you add
  a special environment variable to your batch file.  This variable will
  limit the amount of extended memory allocated for the game.  Without this
  variable, each session will grab the full amount of extended memory available.
  For example, if you have 64 meg extended memory, each session will allocate
  the FULL 64 meg (this is possible with virtual memory).  You can safely
  limit the extended memory to 1024K, and using the @ key for your particular
  game you can modify this amount to optimize your memory use.  A session
  should have at least 30K available to it at the main command prompt right
  after startup.

  To allocate 1024K extended memory to the DPMI version, add this line to your
  batch file:

  SET RTM=EXTMAX 1024

  This environment variable should be applied to TW2002.EXE, TEDIT.EXE,
  EXTERN.EXE and NONPSERV.EXE for optimal performance.

Trade Wars Gold Edition:

  There are many new features included in the Trade Wars Gold Edition.  You
  can view the accompanying document, TWGOLD.DOC, for information about that
  product.  You can also access the Gold editors in TEDIT and, though you'll
  be unable to make any changes, you'll have full access to the context-
  sensitive help screens.  See TWORDER.FRM and TWUPDATE.FRM for instructions
  about registering the Gold Edition or upgrading your game to Gold features.

Changes to TEDIT:

  Some new features have been added to TEDIT.  They are self-documenting.
  Also, the functionality of the TEDIT prompts has been revamped.  The range
  prompt bears mentioning.

  Range input text (Low to High) [Default] : _

  The Low and High values, if present, are boundaries for the input.  The
  default is the current value associated with the input, so that a <CR>
  will leave the field unchanged.

  A value can be entered (as long as it falls within the range), or one of
  two special keys may be used.

  < : Enter minimum value.  The prompt is terminated with the Low value
      entered as the result.  The , key will function identically.
  > : Enter maximum value.  The prompt is terminated with the High value
      entered as the result.  The . key will function identically.

Running Multiple TW Games:

  You can set up a main game directory and run multiple individual games from
  other subdirectories.  For example, you could create a directory C:\TW2002
  for the game files and then create three games running in directories
  C:\TW2002\GAME1, C:\TW2002\GAME2, and C:\TW2002\GAME3.  Any game specific
  data files will be created in the subdirectory for that specific game.
  To create these games, go into the main game directory, C:\TW2002, and
  run BIGBANG with the DATA= command pointing to the desired directory.
  For game 1, that would be

  CD \TW2002  
  BIGBANG DATA=C:\TW2002\GAME1

  This will generate the files TW*.DAT and TWINDEX.NDX, plus any Gold data
  files in the subdirectory GAME1\GOLD.

  The only data file that will not be generated in the individual game directory
  is TWNODE.DAT, the BBS node information file.  That file will always reside
  in the main executable directory.

  To run these individual games by BBS node, set the data path for each node.

  To run these games from any node, leave the BBS node data path set to
  default and pass the DATA= command to the game when it is called.  For
  example, you would run game 1 like this:

  TW2002 DATA=C:\TW2002\GAME1 or
  TEDIT DATA=C:\TW2002\GAME1 or
  EXTERN DATA=C:\TW2002\GAME1

  It is not necessary to change into the directory of either the game or
  the data files before running.  Simply execute the game with the full path
  and file name and it will change into the proper directory at execution.

  If no data path is specified in either the node data path or with a DATA=
  command, the game will look for the data files in the same directory as the
  game executables.
